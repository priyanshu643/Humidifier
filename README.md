# DIY Humidifier Project with Custom PCB

Welcome to the repository for my DIY Humidifier project! This project aims to create a functional and efficient humidifier, featuring a custom-designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to integrate all components neatly.

I, Priyanshu, personally designed the custom PCB for this project, focusing on creating a compact and tailored solution for this humidifier.

## ‚ú® Features
*   Automated humidity control (potentially using a DHT sensor or similar).
*   Compact design thanks to the custom PCB.
*   (Add more specific features as your project develops, e.g., display, user controls, mist level adjustment).
*   Reliable operation due to integrated components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Components (Example - update with your actuals)
*   **Microcontroller:** (e.g., ESP32, ESP8266, Arduino Nano)
*   **Humidity Sensor:** (e.g., DHT11, DHT22, SHT31)
*   **Atomizer/Mist Maker Module:**
*   **Power Supply:** (e.g., 5V USB, dedicated power module)
*   **Control Circuitry:** (e.g., MOSFET or Relay to drive the atomizer)
*   **Custom PCB:** Designed by me ([Priyanshu](https://github.com/priyanshu643)).

## üîå PCB Design
The core of this project is the custom PCB, designed by me ([Priyanshu](https://github.com/priyanshu643)). This board was developed to:
*   Minimize wiring and potential connection issues.
*   Provide a stable platform for all electronic components.
*   Achieve a compact form factor.


## (Software)
The firmware (likely Arduino C/C++ ) for controlling the humidifier can be found in the `/firmware` or `/src` directory. It handles:
*   Implementing the control logic for humidity regulation.
*   (Potentially) Interfacing with pushbuttons.

## üöÄ Getting Started (To be detailed)
1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/priyanshu643/Humidifier.git`
2.  Gather all necessary hardware components.
3.  Solder the components onto the PCB.
4.  Upload the firmware from the `/firmware` directory to the microcontroller.
5.  Assemble the humidifier unit.
6.  Test and calibrate!

## üìö Further Reading & Resources
To gain more knowledge on the topics involved in this project, consider exploring documentation and tutorials related to:
*   **Microcontroller Programming:** (e.g., Arduino Reference).
*   **Humidity Sensors:**
*   **PCB Design Basics:** Tutorials for your chosen EDA software (e.g., KiCad).
*   **Soldering Techniques:** Guides for through-hole and SMD soldering.
*   **else** every another required documents are presented in document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Now5aLwraL7LMPHntZHk1pkwH7MLB5T6pkGFi95Vkyw/edit?usp=sharing
